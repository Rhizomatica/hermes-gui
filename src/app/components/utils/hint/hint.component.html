        The steps to find this feature in Deltachat are: -> Advanced -> Autocrypt, Prefer End-To-End Encryption: turn

        SWR - Standing Wave Ratio. This indicates how efficiently power is transmitted from the radio transmitter to the
        antenna. A low SWR (close to 1) indicates that the antenna is set to the correct operating frequency and the
        system will operate efficiently. A high SWR suggests that the antenna is not set to the same frequency as the
        transmitter or that it is damaged. The transmission will not be optimal and trying to operate the system
        with a high SWR can damage the transmitter and will likely cause the radio to go into protection Mode.

        As communication between stations is unidirectional, transmissions must be scheduled to happen according to the

        Keep in mind that due to the scheduling of transmission of the messages, they may take a while to arrive,

      <p>
        To know what to do in case of an error, you first need to know which component is causing the problem.

        To find out if the problem is with the device connecting to the network (cell phone, tablet, computer), the
        easiest way is to test access from another device, or from another browser on the same device. If the problem is
        only with you, it is possible that the problem is in the network settings of your device. Check below the
        necessary settings to access the HERMES network:

        If this does not solve your problem, try cleaning your browser's history and logging in again, or change
        browsers. If none of this resolves the problem, it is possible that your device is incompatible with the
        network.

        <span *ngIf="bitx == 'S'">
          In case of problem in the Antenna, a LED will light up on the server box, in this case, check the correct
        </span> position of the power supply wires and check the position and integrity of the Antenna, coaxial cable,
        and the transmitter.

        If the messages in the transmission list are not being transmit, check if the radio settings have
        been changed, in which case it could be that the other stations are offline or on a different frequency. To
        remedy you could restore the
        factory default settings.

        If the problem is with the digital radio, there will be an error message when the administrator goes into
        Administration -> radio configuration.

        If you receive a message saying server offline, your equipment is likely turned off. If the message persists, it
        could be that some part of the system is corrupted. In this case, you may need to take your equipment to a place
        with internet for online maintenance.
