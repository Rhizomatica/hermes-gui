    <h2 #introduction i18n="@@intro1">Introduction</h2>
    <p i18n="@@p1">
        HERMES provides a telecommunication system through the use of shortwave / HF radio.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p2">
        Hermes system allows transmission of text and files between connected stations, through public messages, sent
        through this interface or private messages, though Deltachat application or webmail interface.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p2a">
        The system uses a digital radio that schedules transmissions between stations using the UUCP protocol. All
        communication between stations are encrypted and happen outside the internet.
    </p>
    <h2 #introduction i18n="@@intro">Hermes Box</h2>
    <p i18n="@@p1bx">
        On the front of Hermes Box there are 4 different led lights:
    </p>
    <img class="helpimg" title="leds" src="assets/img/leds.jpg" />
    <p i18n="@@p2bx">
        SYS: System LED, blinks when the system is not ready to be used. SYS LED typically blinks when the equipment is
        turning on or when it is turning off; when the system is on it will stay solid green.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p3bx">
        ANT: Green when the antenna is functioning properly. ANT LED turns Red when a high SWR value is detected,
        meaning the high SWR protection is enabled and the radio will not transmit. SWR protection needs to be reset if
        active (Red), for the radio to became operational again, which can be done in the radio administrative
        interface. Check the RF cable and Antenna before resetting in the interface;
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p4bx">
        CONECTADO: LED on (solid Green) means that the station is connected to another station;
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p5bx">
        TX: LED on means the radio is transmitting. When this LED is off, it is in receive mode. If the CONECTADO LED is
        on and the TX LED is off, the station is actively receiving. During active communication with another station
        the CONECTADO LED will be solid Green and the TX LED will turn on and off;
    </p>
    <h2 #webint i18n="@@webinterface">Web Interface</h2>
    <p i18n="@@p3">
        When accessing the local Hermes WiFi network through a cellphone or computer, you will be directed to the HERMES
        web interface. From there you can read public messages sent to your station, create users for e-mail, find the
        download links for deltachat app and send public messages between stations if you are allowed to. It's also
        possible manage and administer the system from the web interface.
    </p>
    <h3 #publicm i18n="@@publicmessagesh">Public Messages</h3>
    <p i18n="@@p4">
        Public messages can be sent between stations, and are listed on the main page of the web interface. Each
        stations can be configured to determine who can send public messages, if everyone, if only registered users or
        only admin users.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p5">
        If sending messages is allowed for you, you can compose them by clicking on the <span class="icon"><img
                src="/assets/svg/edit.svg"></span> icon. On the message is possible to attach files such as images or
        sound files.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p6">
        Public messages can be sent to your own station, which is a easy way to publicize news inside your own
        community.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p7">
        Public messages can also be password protected, which means that only the ones that know the password will be
        able to read their content, but their description still will be readable by everyone.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p9">
        Have in mind that once a password for the message (has to be at least 4 characters) is defined, there is no way
        to recover it, nor to change it.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p10">
        A system administrator can change who can send public messages and who can attach files on messages between
        stations: everyone withe access to the network, only registered users, or only administrators.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p122">
        Because the radio propagation of data is very low, file attachments are constrained to 20kb sizes. The system
        will accept inputs for image and sound up to 30mB and for other files util 2mb, and will try to compress them to
        fit the maximum size for packages. For image and sound, the resolution can be changed, and the quality may be
        affected. For other formats, a simple compressor will be applied and message packages with size greater than
        20kb may not be transmitted.
    </p>
    <h3 #private i18n="@@p01">Private messages</h3>
    <p i18n="@@q02">
        Private messages in the HERMES system work through personal e-mails. Any user can create an Hermes email account
        by clicking on the "create user" option on the login screen.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@q02a">
        Each workstation has a different domain, which can be seen at the top of the interface. On this station, all
        emails will be created within the domain {{system.domain}} and will look like this:
        user_name@{{system.domain}}. Where username is the username used when creating the user.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@q02b">
        Through a redirect, HERMES emails can be sent to and received from external servers, but be aware that there is
        a limitation when attaching data due to the limitations of data transmission capacity over radio.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@q03b">
        On the email link on the web interface you will find links for webmail (roundcube), for Deltachat download, and
        also it's possible to select users to send messages with your configured email client.
    </p>
    <h2 #deltachat>Deltachat</h2>
    <p i18n="@@q03">
        Through the Deltachat app, one can use HERMES emails to conduct personal message exchange communications
        (similar to chat); this app works on most smartphones and has a similar appearance to Whatsapp or Telegram. Keep
        in mind that due to the scheduling of transmission of the messages, they may take a while to arrive, depending
        on the amount of messages in the queue and the gateway station's schedule of operation.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@q03a">
        To download Deltachat, select one of the packages below, according to your phone's operating system:
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/downloads/deltachat.apk" target="_blank" download="deltachat.apk">Android</a><br>
        <a href="/downloads/deltachat.exe" target="_blank" download="deltachat.exe">Windows</a><br>

        <a href="/downloads/deltachat.dmg" target="_blank" download="deltachat.dmg">Mac OSX</a><br>
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@q04">
        On Iphone and ipad you will need to download the app from the App Store in a place with internet.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h5 i18n="@@dconfig">Configuration</h5>
    <p i18n="@@dl01">
        The HERMES system includes a compression system suitable for multimedia messages like images or audio being sent
        over HF. End-to-end encryption should be disabled in order to allow the server-based image and audio compression
        to work properly, otherwise image and audio exchange will not be
        possible.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@dl02">
        The steps to find this feature in Deltachat are: -> Advanced -> Autocrypt, Prefer End-To-End Encryption: turn
        off: If you wish, you can also turn on email delivery monitoring to check if your emails were correctly
        delivered.
    </p>
    <span><img class="infoimg" title="Deltachat Advanced settings" src="assets/img/adv_p2pe_es.jpeg" /></span>
    <p i18n="@@dl03">Deltachat, by default, tags its emails and show only the "known" messages (emails) that was sent by
        another Deltachat application. In order to be able to interact with e-mails from any e-mail client software,
        enable the option "show all emails". The steps to find this feature in Deltachat are: Burger Menu ( <span
            class="icon"><img src="assets/svg/bars-solid.svg"></span> ) -> Settings -> Chats and Media -> Show Classic
        E-Mails -> All.
    </p>
    <img class="infoimg" title="Deltachat email settings" src="assets/img/allemails_es.jpeg" />
    <p i18n="@@deltachatroundcube">
        In order to configure DeltaChat, first an e-mail account should be created, on the creat user session, acessed
        trhough admin or email link on the main menu. In order to login to an e-mail account, only the e-mail address
        and password fields should be filled, as shown below. The user and password will be the same as those created
        when first creating a login on HERMES and for use with the RoundCube webmail, such as:
        username@{{system.domain}}.
    </p>
    <img class="infoimg" title="Deltachat login" src="assets/img/login_es.jpeg" />
    <h3 #transm i18n="@@tranmissionhp">Transmission List</h3>
    <p i18n="@@p11h">
        Once the messages are sent, they will go to a transmission queue before arriving at their final destination. A
        system administrator can cancel the packages before they are sent, and also delete the sent and received
        messages. This is a task that need to be done often to avoid that the space in the server ends.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p12h">
        As the communication between the stations are unidirectional, the transmissions are schedules to happen
        acconding to the central staion, alternating between reception and transmission events. In an emergency case,
        the system administrator can force message transmission queue by clicking on the "transmit now" link. This can
        interrupt receiving messages from other stations for a while.
    </p>
    <h3 #sysa i18n="@@sysadmh">System Administration</h3>
    <p i18n="@@p13">
        To access admin features, you need an admin password, while anyone can create an user account, and only the
        system's admins can create new administrator users.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p14">
        Inside the admin section, an admin user will find the following options:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span i18n="@@p15"> Users management: allows creation of new users, updating data of registered users and to
            delete users of the system. Every username correspond to a email account with the same name of the kind

    <p i18n="@@p16">
        Administrators can also give admin powers to regular users, by clicking on the "is admin" checkbox on the update
        user interface
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p16a">
        Message administration: In this section an administrator can determine who can send public messages, and who can
        attach files in public messages between stations: anyone, only registered users, or only administrators.

    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p16ss">
        Transmission List: Shows the jobs on the queue for transmission, with their sizes and destination, where an
        admin can delete messages on the queue. It also has the option to transmit now, that should be used only in
        exeptional emergency cases.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p17">
        Network info: displays information about the system, such as network addresses, call sign, server name, etc.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p18">
        Stations: provides a list of the connected stations on the system. If the station is a central station, it also
        allows to select which stations will be enabled to message transmission.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@p18ss">
        Central Station: This menu will be shown only on the central station, and is where the admins will set the
        schedules for transmission to the other stations.

    <p i18n="@@p19">
        Detailed Log: provides access to system logs, such as email logs and uucp logs, that register every activity on
        the system.

        Radio configuration: provides an interface to access and change frequency and radio transmission mode. It also
        allows to restore default radio configuration.
    </p>
    <h2 #trouble i18n="@@truble2">Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p i18n="@@t01">
        To access the system, three main components are needed: a smartphone or a computer, a HERMES server and an
        antenna with a transmitter.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@t02">
        To know what to do in case of an error, you first need to know which component is causing the problem.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@t03">
        To find out if the problem is with the device connecting to the network (cell phone, tablet, computer), the
        easiest way is to test access from another device, or from another browser on the same device. If the problem is
        only with you, it is possible that the problem is in the network settings. Check below the necessary settings to
        access the Hermes network:
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@t04">
        If this does not solve your problem, try cleaning your browser's history and logging in again, or change
        browsers. If none of this resolves the problem, it is possible that your device is incompatible with the
        network.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@t05">
        In case of problem in the Antenna, a LED will light up on the server box, in this case, check the correct
        position of the power supply wires and check the position and integrity of the Antenna, coaxial cable, and the
        transmitter.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@t07">
        If the messages in the transmission list are not being transmitted over time, check if the radio settings have
        been changed, in which case it could be that the other stations are offline. To remedy you could restore the
        factory default settings.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@t08">
        If the problem is with the digital radio, there will be an error message when the administrator goes into
        Administration -> radio configuration.
    </p>
    <p i18n="@@t09">
        If you receive a message saying server offline, your equipment is likely turned off. If the message persists, it
        could be that some part of the system is corrupted. In this case, you may need to take your equipment to a place
        with internet for online maintenance.
